Objective
Develop a generative model to enhance urban environmental sounds for better classification. This involves tasks such as denoising audio clips to improve the clarity of specific sounds like conversations or emergency signals within noisy urban environments. This enhancement not only aids in classification but can also be used to generate clearer audio samples for training or practical applications, such as hearing aids or smart city monitoring systems.

Public Dataset: UrbanSound8K, which includes diverse urban sounds that often contain significant background noise.

Performance Metrics
  Effectiveness (Predictive and Generative Performance):
    Enhanced Audio Quality: Assess improvements in clarity and noise reduction using objective measures such as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) or Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ).
    Classification Accuracy: After enhancement, how accurately the model classifies the sounds.
    F1 Score: To address the precision-recall balance in classifying sounds post-enhancement.
  Efficiency (Runtime):
    Generation and Inference Time: Time required to enhance and then classify sounds.
    Model Efficiency: Evaluation of computational resources needed for running the model in real-time applications.
  
Minimum Performance Required
  TBD: After initial testing, set specific goals for SNR or PESQ improvements, classification accuracy, and efficiency metrics.
  
Metrics Presented to Key Stakeholders
Technical Stakeholders:
  Detailed metrics on audio enhancement quality (SNR, PESQ) and classification accuracy.

  Non-Technical Stakeholders:
    Visual and auditory demonstrations of before and after audio enhancement.
    High-level benefits of the model, such as its potential impact on improving urban life through better noise management and public safety communication systems
